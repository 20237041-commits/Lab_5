                    <h3>What is cryptocurrency</h3>
                    A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to
                     counterfeit or double-spend.Cryptocurrencies exist on decentralized networks that utilizeblockchain technologyâ€”a
                      distributed ledger secured by a network of computers.
    
                    A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central or governing authority.
                     However, laws and policies set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have placed policies and standards
                      that must be abided by institutions, such as <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/best-crypto-exchanges-5071855">crypto exchanges</a> and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/best-online-brokers-4587872">online brokerage firms</a> that offer cryptocurrency.

                      <h3>Types of Cryptocurrency</h3>
                    Many cryptocurrencies were created to facilitate work done on the blockchain they are built on. For example,
                     <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ethereum.asp">Ethereum's</a> native digital coin, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ether-cryptocurrency.asp">ether (ETH)</a>, was designed to be used as payment for validating transactions and
                      opening blocks. When the blockchain transitioned to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp"></a> in September 2022, ether inherited an additional
                       duty as the blockchain's staking mechanism.

                    The XRP Ledger's native cryptocurrency, XRP, is designed for financial institutions to facilitate transfers between
                     different geographies.

                    <h3>How to buy cryptocurrency</h3>
